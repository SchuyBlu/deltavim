# Schuy's Neovim Config
Hello! This is a very basic setup for Neovim that takes advantage of the [Lazy Plugin Manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim). 

# Installation.
Installation is as easy the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/SchuyBlu/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```
The first call to `nvim` installs `Lazy` and all plugins.
